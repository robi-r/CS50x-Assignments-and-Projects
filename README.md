# CS50x â€” Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science

This repository contains my solutions, problem sets, and final project from [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard University's Introduction to Computer Science.

CS50x covers foundational topics in computer science and programming. It's a great course for beginners and those wanting to revisit the fundamentals.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- C Programming (arrays, pointers, memory)
- Algorithms (searching, sorting, recursion)
- Data Structures (linked lists, hash tables, tries)
- Memory Management
- File I/O
- Python and SQL
- Web Programming with Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## ðŸ’¡ Final Project

Details and source code for my final project can be found in the `/final_project` folder.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

Each problem set folder includes the problem description, my code, and instructions (if applicable). Some problems are implemented in C, so you'll need to compile with:

```bash
make filename
./filename
